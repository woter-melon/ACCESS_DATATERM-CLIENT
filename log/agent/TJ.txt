Name: TJ. Didn't have a name when I first saw him. 
Age: Like a few months
Height: Pretty tall. Maybe 6'2?
Weight: He's a cursed spirit, so I don't think it counts. 

I've never seen a cursed spirit get so much stronger so quick. I mean, finger bearers, yeah. But this one is unaided. Even crazier, He became like, way smarter. He's pretty much sentient. 

Craziest of all... He can use RCT?????? I can't!! How? That's a crazy technique!! He said he has to be careful with where he aims it thoug. makes sense. 

Goro did mention he used to be smaller. I can't believe it. This is probably a first ever. Well, besides the fact he reminds me a bit of dad... But he changed in a different way. And I don't think TJ used to be human... Was he?
