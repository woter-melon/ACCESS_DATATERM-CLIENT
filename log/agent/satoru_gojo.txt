Name: Satoru Gojo
Age: 29??? No way. December 7th, so he turned not too long ago. Wish he had a perty.
Height: Tall. 
Weight: Lighter than he looks, but I think he uses his technique. 

My teacher! The strongest guy in history! I swear I get goosebumps whenever he calls my name. At the same time, he's kinda lame sokmetimes. It's such a weird difference. 

I actually think he's stronger than Sukuna. And Dad definitely can't get through infinity so he loses too. 

I still don't know how he hasn't sussed me out. Or maybe he knows, but just decided to go easy on me. I really feel like it's that second one. I don't wanna do anything bad here.
