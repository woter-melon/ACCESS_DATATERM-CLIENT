Name: Megumi Fushiguro
Age: 15. But his birthday is coming! December 22.
Height: about 5'9
Weight: 74 kg. They told me he was super thin, but he's been bulking! 

I heard someone mention he might b from the Zenin clan cause he's got the 10 shadows. I can see that since they don't mess around. He landed 2 black flashes in one day while sparring with Takashi! Can't believe he just withstood them. 

He's super aloof though, so I dunno a lot about him. He's not super social. Said he owes a lot of it to his dad. Dunno what that means, but I dont think I wanna find out.
