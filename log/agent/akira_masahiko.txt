Name: Akira Masahiko
Age: 18. Said he got held back a bit
Height: 6'4. Wow. 
Weight: 90 kilos. 

Gentle giant. Don't have much to say. Just wish he kinda... Got out of that scaredy cat mentality. You can't help people if you can't even help yourself! 

Though I guess the job of a sorcerer is't directly helping people.

I thought there was a reason he wore baggy clotehs, but he's actually not that thin.
