Name: Dimi Velichko
Age: Mentally 6
Height: If he let his hair grow out he'd reach 6 feet. But right now, I don't buy it. 
Weight: 76 kg. But having him around makes my eyelids heavier so maybe he's got some gravity going on. 

If I see. 

ONE. 

More charlie kirk picture. Or one more charlie kirk video. Or ONE. MORE. WE ARE CHARLIE KIRK EDIT ON THIS GUY'S PHONE; I'M GONNA BLOW MY COVER!!!!! 

Well, I doubt I could beat him up. He's actually pretty strong, and Viktor would jump in too. 

Anyway, he's my class mate. I still care for him. It's like having a stupid dog. I think.
