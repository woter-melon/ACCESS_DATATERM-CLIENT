Name: Viktor Draganov
Age: I'm sorry for ever calling you childish Dimi. 
Height: Exact same as Dimi
Weight: Same as Dimi. Are they twins actually? 

So, they said they're not. But I'm a little iffy. 

Anyway, this dude has a loving family that messages him often from home. He just wakes up every day chooses to act like that. Inexcusable. The brooding silence is louder than the brainrot blasting from Dimi's phone. And the stuff he says... Ugh. You are NOT sasuke.
