Name: Syl. I... Have never heard her last name, actually.
Age: My age I think
Height: Taller than me by a bit
Weight: She's stronger than she looks, So I'm thinking... 70 and a bit. 

She's so driven. It's like she's got everything figured out. I feel a little jealous about it. And she also doesn't mind me at all. I'm glad I'm part of her team. 

I've been working on a gift for her with Benedetto, and I'm so excited to give it to her!! I hope she realizes how much I look up to her.
