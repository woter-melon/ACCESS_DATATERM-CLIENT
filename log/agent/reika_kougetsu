Cocky. But I don't miind cause She can back it up pretty well. 

I dunno how I feel about her, actually. She's awesome sooometimes, but then she goes and does stuff like sacrifice a bunch of her strength and cursed energy for a binding vow to win ONE race. 

In the little time I spent in Hiroshima, she was just like that too. Always taking crazy risks. And they always paid off too. 

She's cheery, and super confident. If it's an act, it's a really, really good one. I think she'll get as strong as she was, if not stronger.
