Name: Sakura Tachibana
Age: 14. She... Doesn't look her age
Height: She was like 5'2 a few months ago. But she's almost my height right now. 
Weight: Okay, I'm not crazy. Is she hitting a growth spurt?? 

Sakura! One of my best... Or I guess only friends at the academy. We just chatted and immediately hit it off. I dunno why though. She's got that mature perspective on stuff, but she's also still fun. We just get each other I guess. 

Still sets off a few questions though. Maybe she's awakening a cursed technique! Or maybe she HAS a cursed technique to stay young! Damn, that'd actually be relatable af.
