Age: 16. August 17th
Height: she's a little shorter than me, so I'm pretty sure she's like 5'3
Weight: I'm not that courageous. 

Such a cool technique! I thought it'd feel like more of the same for me but it's super interesting! I hope nothing happens to her, but at the same time I'd love to make a hammer out of her kit and see what I can come up with. 

She kinda came off as arrogant, brash, self absorbed, vain, and confrontational when we first talked, but she's actually chill. I heard she landed a black flash at the same time as Itadori. Bf with her bf? Haha just kidding. Unless?
