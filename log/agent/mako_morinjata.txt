Name: Mako Morinjata
Age: I really did think he was in his late 20s. But no. Not 20 yet.
Height: I sprained my neck looking at him once.
Weight: Heavier than he looks? I mean he's thin but he weighs... Dunno. A lot. 

He's intimidating. He's actually a huge softie though! And he helps literally everyone. Like a knight. 

His technique is so unique as well. Reminds me a bit of Goro's. But I did see Mako's before. And his mom has it too, so that's three with the technique? That's not a lot but it's weird that it happened three times. 

Oh! Speaking of his mom! She's a secial grade?? Like how Mr Gojo is. No wonder he's so strong. Between him, Takashi, and Ulysses, they could lift the Empire State!!! 

He's deceptively smart too. Like, astute I guess. He definitely suspects of me. I don't blame him. No matter how far from home I get, I'll always...
