Name: Takashi Kimura
Age: I think 18
Height: I wonder why so many of my classmates are so tall
Weight: lighter than he looks? 

Takashi is SO smart! He gets realy good grades, and he focuses super well. And I didn't think it was possible, but he knows even more taijutsu than TJ?? How?? 

Suoer upstanding. He's probably the most polite in the class. Though it feels like he holds back a lot. Except when he's gotta help someone... He's kinda like a superhero.
