Name: Goro Takemura
Age: I think he's my age
Height: One of the only groupies that has a normal height it feels like.
Weight: He's pretty athletic. I think maybe 80 something or under 80. 

Scary!!! When I first got into a competition against him, I thought he was gonna go wild and do something crazy, but he didn't. Now that I'm in his class though, I know he's actually kind of a softie. 

Well not really. I still think he might listen to Pumped Up Kicks, but I can't let him know that. He cares a lot, but mainly about curses, which I guess makes sense. Making creatures makes you feel a lotta things. 

He's not actually bad. I like him. He reminds me a bit of dad though. Always seeking becoming stronger. But I'd much rather he be stronger than my dad.
