Trouble. I don't even wanna keep an entry of him. Or her. I don't know. I can't believe dad would work with him for so long. He might be more evil than Sukuna. 

Addendum: I guess I'll have to. 

Old sorcerer. Even older than me and dad. Dunno by how much, hut he... She? Sometimes calls back to the heian era when they¿re chatting with dad. They're probably the smartest person I've ever known. I can't imagine how, but I'm guessing they had to use their technique as a framework for the whole cursed object into taking over bodies invention. 

Addendum_2: Okay. Made probably the greatest invention I'll ever have made. Not gutsy enough to call myself smarter than him, but Ichor is a big step up from corpse wax preserved toes. 

Addendum_3: They've been getting more reckless. Or maybe more active. Lots of stuff is happening recently, and I think it's all cause of them. I'm a little worried. Dad's only ever kept to himself, but... I dunno. I think this Kenjaku person has way bigger intentions.
