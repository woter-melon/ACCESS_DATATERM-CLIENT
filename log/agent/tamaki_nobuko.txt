Name: Tamaki Nobuko
Age: 16
Height: about 5'8
Weight: 76 kg. WOW. She's gotta be swole 

She's like.. So orderly. And quiet. And strong! Super physically strong and commanding! Between her the groupies... What are they feeding these guys? Her physique reminds me of Ulysses. 

No no. Wait. Not that kinda diary. I'll have to type this one out manually. 

She's strong, and likes to punch Juzo a lot, so she's one of my favorite classmates already. I'm surprised she still does her makeup. At least, cause she said she doesn't like super girly things. Probably gonan clash with Nobara on that.

I mean, Nobara's kinda right though. You can be girly AND strong! Like me! Well, maybe I'm not that strong. 

... Am I girly?
