Sukuna's vessel. I thought he would be scary, but he's like the nicest, behind Ulysses and Syl and Sakura. He is very strong though! Like some of the other guys. I don't know what the deal is with them. Well, with them, yeah. But I dunno why Yuji is so strong without cursed energy. 

He said he likes karaoke, watching TV and impersonations. And he likes rice and noodles with stuff?? He didn't specify.
