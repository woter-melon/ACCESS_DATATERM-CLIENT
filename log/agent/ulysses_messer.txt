Name: Ulysses Messer
Age: I dunno. I think he's older than most of the class
Height: He's tall, but when he transforms he's massive. Like the low t█████████
Weight: suuuper heavy

He's the best. He's like the only classmate I get along with without any problem. Even Sakura has her qualms. He said he wasn't a great person before, but It's really hard to imagine it. He's only ever been nice to me. And really funny. He's maybe my favorite person in the world... I really like him.

I gotta keep secrets but I keep slipping up around him. I really tried to stay low since I got here, but it's getting harder each time. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm scared. I don't wanna go back again.
