SUBJECT: ICHOR
CLASSIFICATION: Liquid Cursed Object. Energy Storage Medium
STATE: Stable (Controlled Conditions)

Physical Description:
Viscous liquid, density notably above water (≈1.36 g/cm³). Coloration observed as blue-green with internal luminescence. Emission wavelength fluctuates between 480–510 nm under low ambient light. Luminosity increases proportionally with cursed energy saturation. Substance exhibits faint self-agitation when uncontained.

Odor negligible. Taste untested (see safety notes).

Containment:
Non-reactive glass, ceramic, or reinforced polymer vessels recommended. Metallic containers show gradual CE leakage (≈3–5% per 24 hours). When unsealed, Ichor begins passive energy dissipation after ~90 seconds.

Cursed Energy Capacity:

Average storage density: 4.6×10⁴ CE units per milliliter

Maximum observed saturation before instability: 6.1×10⁴ CE units/mL

Capacity varies slightly depending on source sample consistency

For reference, 1 liter of Ichor can sustain a medium-scale barrier array for approximately 72–96 hours without external input.

Energy Output:

Passive output (idle): ~120 CE units/sec

Active draw (laboratory systems): up to 3.2×10³ CE units/sec before structural degradation

Output remains stable until volume depletion falls below 12%

Unlike solid cursed objects, output curve is linear and predictable.

Yield:
Extraction efficiency averages 180–260 mL per subject, dependent on physiological factors and prior CE exposure. Yield loss during conversion process remains below 4%.

Bulk processing significantly reduces spatial storage requirements compared to solid-object preservation methods.

Longevity:

Shelf life (sealed, inactive): Indefinite (no measurable decay over 140-year observation period)

Active use lifespan: Dependent on draw rate

Residual volume below 5% becomes inert and visually opaque

Interaction Notes:

Absorption through organic tissue results in immediate system integration & subject dissolution

No rejection response observed in compatible hosts. Batch variance affects hazard level

Quality contagion observed when batches cross contaminate

Hazards:

Prolonged proximity (>6 hours) may induce sympathetic cursed energy response. Phenomenon inconclusive as of now.

Unregulated contact correlates with identity dissociation, manic episodes, involuntary memori callbacks, and involuntary technique manifestation.

Direct contact prone to lead to bodily dissolution in the substance. Proceed with extreme caution.

Corpse personnel rotation advised. Fully automatic personnel are unaffected by dissoluting properties.

Remarks:
Liquid state allows for modular storage, redistribution, and large-scale energy deployment without the logistical constraints of discrete cursed artifacts. High scalability. Highly efficient.

Further classification pending. Proposed solute pending. See other/projects.txt.

Addendum: Ha. Told you dad. The puppets DO have a function. Maybe we can have a lab without robots that are weird half cursed energy flesh things next time. 

Addendum_2: Well, color me surprised. I don't have to make more Ichor the complicated way. I can just dump people in there and they dissolve. This sure feels real morally justifiable! I'm totally not gonan burn in hell for all this. Thanks dad.

Addendum_3: Okay. I ran away again. Back to square one. Sure. But now that I'm checking the history; No dissolution? This thing doesn't melt people now. Was it because I wasn't drawing cursed energy from the Ichor that it... Calmed down??? I'll have to check. Way more testing necessary.
