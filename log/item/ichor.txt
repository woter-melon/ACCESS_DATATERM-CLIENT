SUBJECT: ICHOR
CLASSIFICATION: Liquid Cursed Object. Energy Storage Medium
STATE: Stable (Controlled Conditions)

Physical Description:
Viscous liquid, density notably above water (≈1.36 g/cm³). Coloration observed as blue-green with internal luminescence. Emission wavelength fluctuates between 480–510 nm under low ambient light. Luminosity increases proportionally with cursed energy saturation. Substance exhibits faint self-agitation when uncontained.

Odor negligible. Taste untested (see safety notes).

Containment:
Non-reactive glass, ceramic, or reinforced polymer vessels recommended. Metallic containers show gradual CE leakage (≈3–5% per 24 hours). When unsealed, Ichor begins passive energy dissipation after ~90 seconds.

Cursed Energy Capacity:

Average storage density: 4.6×10⁴ CE units per milliliter

Maximum observed saturation before instability: 6.1×10⁴ CE units/mL

Capacity varies slightly depending on source sample consistency

For reference, 1 liter of Ichor can sustain a medium-scale barrier array for approximately 72–96 hours without external input.

Energy Output:

Passive output (idle): ~120 CE units/sec

Active draw (laboratory systems): up to 3.2×10³ CE units/sec before structural degradation

Output remains stable until volume depletion falls below 12%

Unlike solid cursed objects, output curve is linear and predictable.

Yield:
Extraction efficiency averages 180–260 mL per subject, dependent on physiological factors and prior CE exposure. Yield loss during conversion process remains below 4%.

Bulk processing significantly reduces spatial storage requirements compared to solid-object preservation methods.

Longevity:

Shelf life (sealed, inactive): Indefinite (no measurable decay over 140-year observation period)

Active use lifespan: Dependent on draw rate

Residual volume below 5% becomes inert and visually opaque

Interaction Notes:

Absorption through organic tissue results in immediate system integration & subject dissolution

No rejection response observed in compatible hosts. Batch variance affects hazard level

Quality contagion observed when batches cross contaminate

Hazards:

Prolonged proximity (>6 hours) may induce sympathetic CE influence

Unregulated exposure correlates with identity bleed, memory echoing, and involuntary technique manifestation

Direct contact prone to lead to bodily dissolution in the substance. Proceed with extreme caution.

Corpse personnel rotation advised

Remarks:
Liquid state allows for modular storage, redistribution, and large-scale energy deployment without the logistical constraints of discrete cursed artifacts. High scalability. Highly efficient.

Further classification pending. Proposed solute pending. See projects.
