------ PROJECTS!! ------

PENDING: 

 - Find a way to generate my own cursed energy. 
 
 - Make the OS interface not suck

 - Get away. For real this time.

 - Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck I have to tell them

COMPLETED: 

 - Migrate the entirety of my library into this digital medium. This is gonna hurt. A lot. 

    Note: Got the important bits. 
    Note_2: I'm a genius! Thank you Giovanni Caselli! Page scanning and autolab descriptor made it a breeze. And I finally don't have to search between files. Gosh. Centuries of journal entries. Some of these are embarassing...
    Note_3: Old to-do list was pretty long. Still can't believe I found a way to make non consenting vesselees. Brain man is very industrious, and I work well with him. Like a little too well. Dunno. Anyway, more cursed objects means I won't be running on fumes so often.

 - Find a way to hook up power to all of this. I can put a severed finger into a puppet, but this is a whole different story. 

    Note: Ichor. 
 
 - Find a way to store cursed objects without fuss. 

    Note: Ichor. 
 
 - Find a working, compact method of transport for cursed objects.

Note: Ichor! this might actually be my greatest creation. A liquid cursed object. Take that creepy brain man. I just made it better than you. And I also don't have to eat soapy fingers now. I can blend this thing with fruits.
 
 - Come up with a good solvent for Ichor.

    Note: Ethanol is okay, but not really too viable. It stings, messes with output and can evaporate. "Holy" water starts to loosen out when I leave the place where I got it. Test Dymethyl Sulfoxide.
    Note_2: Success. Dymethyl Sulfoxide doesn't just work. The stuff is pretty stabilized too. Just a little danger... It carries it across the skin. Absorbs super easy. Good for me, but problems for any organic. Or, well, it's a problem if the Ichor doesn't dissolve them before. Wait, would that make them a vessel? Cause they'd eb kinda abosrbing a cursed object... Note, check later.
    Note_3: Well, DMSO proved a little hard to obtain... Just have a little over 24k liters. I think I'll just keep most for storage here and send some towards Tokyo, since I'm spending so much time there.
 
 - Find a way to write... With my mind!!!

    Note: Done. I'm cool like that. Just need to mind the intrusive thoughts.

 - Seal off the terminal. 

    Note: Dad doesn't even use it. Finally have some privacy in this stupid machine.
