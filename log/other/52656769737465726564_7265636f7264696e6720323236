(An audio recording. A female voice speaks to another male, familiar one.)

F - "I still don't know why you'd ask for these blueprints. My associate wasn't dear to sharing them with us, you know?" 

M - "Your part means honoring the deal, not asking why." 

F - "Still... You're a little demanding, are you, young man?" 

M - "Information of Satoru Gojo's whereabouts wasn't enough?" 

F - "Right, right. None of this would have been possible without you. I suppose that's what you want to hear." 

M - "..." 

F - "Oh, but you are not so subtle, young man. You don't trust my dear friend to honor his end of the deal?" 

M - "I just doubt he could do the work of the patchwork curse." 

F - "Oh, but don't you worry. You'll be satisfied, that I promise. I mean... You've met our dear friend Talent, have you? He was no more than a wretch... And with his last, dying wish... Pop! Out he came." 

M - "As a curse." 

F - "Hm. It was merely what he chose. But for you, we may have just a big, strong body to fulfill all your dreams with..." 

M - "Don't. Touch me." 

F - "Right. It hurts. Apologies. But don't you worry. You'll see. Happy as you'll be, walking out in one piece from all of this."
